**Contributors**

**Time**
* Started September 15
* Hours
    * *Weston:* ~30 hours
    * *Matthew:* ~50 hours
    * *Guhan:* ? hours

**Roles**
* *Weston:* Implement Cell Automata Model
* *Matthew:* Implement Cell Automata Controller and XML Parsing
* *Guhan:* Implement Cell Automata View and UI

**Resources Used**
* Only the online Java API and resources from class were used.

**Starting the Project**
* Run Main

**Testing the Project**
1. Click "Set Simulation"
2. Chooses one of the simulation XML files in the open window. (Ex. fire.xml)

**Necessary Resorces**
* Each simulation requires 4 XML files to run.
    * grid_config
    * state_config
    * simulation_config
    * one file containing the names of the other three, which is opend in the dialogue.

**Bugs, Extras, More Usage Info**
* Nothing that we know of.

**Impressions**
* I think it would be good to specify, from the beginning, exactly the kinds of capabilities that a CA simulator needs to have. We spent a fair amount of time trying to alloe the user to define whatever neighborhoods they wanted before realizing that that wasn't something that any of the simulations needed..
